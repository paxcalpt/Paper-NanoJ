\begin{abstract}
%Lets try to keep the abstract between 70-150 words, I have noticed no guidance
With the advances in digital microscopy, researchers now have access to a wealth of computational approaches in order to quantify their imaging data. In particular, quantification of colocalization, movement dynamics and structural analysis based on models have become central to fluorescence microscopy. However, researchers are now confronted with choosing between the numerous packages for image quantification. Over the recent years, our lab has built a self-contained framework of image analysis packages with a focus on live-cell super-resolution microscopy, which we called NanoJ, with reference to the popular ImageJ software it is part of. Here, we highlight
the capabilities of using NanoJ at every step of microscopy studies from the image acquisition (NanoJ-Fluidics), artefact correction of the raw data (drift correction, multi-channel alignment) to super-resolution image reconstruction (SRRF), image quality assessment (SQUIRREL) and modelling (NanoJ-VirusMapper) in a single well-established framework.

\subsection*{Software and Hardware Availability}
NanoJ-Fluidics follows open-source software and hardware standards, it is part of the NanoJ project \cite{gustafsson2016fast, culley2018quantitative,gray2016virusmapper}. The steps to assemble a complete functioning system are described in \href{https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoJ-Fluidics/wiki}{https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoJ-Fluidics/wiki}.
